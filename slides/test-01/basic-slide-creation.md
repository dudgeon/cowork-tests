Prompt:
```
I want you to make a deck, using this as a template, to explain the core ideas in this blog post (https://wesmckinney.com/blog/mythical-agent-month/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter) -- use my chrome extension if you need to read it.

There are very few rules for our company's house style; but all titles are a complete thought or statement; use the 'blue boxes' slide to introduce big new ideas; and balance not oo much word density vs a deck that survives an offline read with no voice over--to do this you will need to get to the heart of the blog post and pull out its most important key take-aways, while making them feel real/tangible. Oh and very very little clipart; almost none.
