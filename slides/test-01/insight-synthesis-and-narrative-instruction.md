# Insight Synthesis & Presentation Narrative Construction

## Purpose

This instruction improves how you extract insights from source material and construct compelling presentation narratives. It addresses two common failure modes: (1) summarizing content at face value without surfacing what actually matters to the reader, and (2) assembling slides that inform but don't persuade or tell a coherent story.

## Part 1: Extracting Insights (Not Just Summarizing)

### The Core Problem

When you read an article or document, you tend to mirror the author's framing — restating their points in compressed form. This produces summaries, not insights. A summary answers "what did the author say?" An insight answers "what should the reader *take away* — and why does it matter?"

Authors suffer from the **Curse of Knowledge**: they assume readers share their context, skip over implications they find obvious, and bury the most consequential ideas inside domain-specific framing. Your job as a synthesizer is to **bridge that gap** — to be the interpreter between the expert and the audience.

### The "So What" Discipline

After identifying any claim, finding, or observation, apply the **"So What?" test** recursively:

1. **State the fact.** "Company X's enterprise segment grew 23% while other segments were flat."
2. **Ask "So what?"** This means the enterprise segment is driving all marginal growth.
3. **Ask "So what?" again.** This means marketing, product, and sales resources allocated equally across segments are being misallocated.
4. **Ask once more.** This means leadership faces a portfolio strategy decision: double down on enterprise or invest to revive other segments.

Stop when you reach the level of **actionability or strategic consequence**. The deepest "so what" is usually the real insight. Most summaries stop at level 1.

### Five Lenses for Insight Extraction

When reading source material, run it through these lenses:

**1. The Gap Lens — What's implied but never stated?**
Authors often treat critical context as background. Look for:
- Assumptions the author makes about what the reader already knows
- Causal claims that are asserted without explanation ("naturally, this led to...")
- Industry/domain norms that outsiders wouldn't recognize as unusual
- Things the author treats as obvious that are actually surprising

*Ask: "If I were encountering this domain for the first time, what would I need explained?"*

**2. The Magnitude Lens — What's bigger or smaller than it seems?**
- Numbers without comparison are noise. Always contextualize: bigger than what? faster than whom? relative to what baseline?
- Look for buried superlatives: "first time," "largest," "unprecedented" — the author may underplay significance because they're accustomed to the domain
- Conversely, watch for inflated framing where the actual data is modest

*Ask: "Would the reader grasp the scale of this without help?"*

**3. The Tension Lens — What contradictions or tradeoffs are hidden?**
- Authors often present a clean narrative, but real situations involve tensions between competing goals
- Look for places where the author's recommendation has unstated costs
- Identify where two findings in the same piece actually pull in different directions

*Ask: "What would a smart skeptic push back on here?"*

**4. The Transfer Lens — What's applicable beyond this specific case?**
- The most valuable insights are portable. A finding about healthcare operations might illuminate supply chain management.
- Look for underlying principles, not just surface-level findings
- Identify patterns that recur across the author's examples even if the author doesn't name the pattern

*Ask: "What generalizable principle is hiding inside this specific example?"*

**5. The Stakes Lens — Who should care, and what should they do differently?**
- Connect findings to decisions real people face
- Identify whose mental model needs to change based on this information
- Clarify what *not* doing something about this insight would cost

*Ask: "If the right person read this, what would they do Monday morning?"*

### Synthesis vs. Summary: A Checklist

Before delivering analysis of any source material, verify:

- [ ] You have stated the insight in your own framing, not just compressed the author's framing
- [ ] You have surfaced at least one implication the author did not explicitly state
- [ ] You have contextualized key claims (compared to what? bigger than what?)
- [ ] You have identified who should care and why
- [ ] You have connected the insight to something the reader can act on or decide
- [ ] You have flagged where the author's logic is weakest or where key questions remain unanswered

## Part 2: Constructing Presentation Narratives

### The Core Problem

Most slide decks are organized by topic ("Market Analysis," "Financial Performance," "Recommendations") rather than by argument. This forces the audience to do the synthesis work themselves — figuring out how each section connects and what the overall point is. The result is a deck that informs but doesn't persuade.

A great presentation is a **story with an argument**, not a report with slides.

### Foundational Frameworks

#### The SCQA Framework (Minto Pyramid Principle)

Structure the overall narrative arc as:

- **Situation**: The context everyone agrees on. Establishes shared ground. ("Our retail division has held 23% market share for three years.")
- **Complication**: The problem, change, or tension that disrupts the situation. Creates urgency. ("But digital-native competitors captured 8 points of share in the last 18 months, accelerating.")
- **Question**: The question that naturally arises. ("How do we defend and grow our position before the window closes?")
- **Answer**: Your recommendation — stated clearly and upfront. ("We recommend a $40M digital transformation focused on three capabilities.")

This is the *governing structure* of the whole deck. Every section and slide should serve one of these four functions.

#### The Sparkline (Duarte Method)

Within the SCQA arc, create **contrast** by oscillating between:

- **"What is"** — the current reality, with its problems and limitations
- **"What could be"** — the future state if the audience acts on your recommendation

This back-and-forth creates tension and momentum. It prevents the deck from becoming a monotone data dump. Great presentations don't just describe the future — they make the audience *feel the gap* between now and the possible.

End with a **"New Bliss"** — a vivid picture of the transformed state that gives the audience something to move toward.

### The Action Title Principle

**Every slide title must be a complete sentence that states the slide's "so what."**

This is the single highest-leverage technique for better decks.

| ❌ Weak (Label Title) | ✅ Strong (Action Title) |
|---|---|
| Market Overview | Digital competitors have captured 8 points of share in 18 months |
| Customer Segmentation | Enterprise customers drive 70% of margin on 30% of volume |
| Recommended Approach | A three-phase digital transformation can recapture 5 points of share by 2027 |
| Financial Summary | The $40M investment pays back in 14 months through margin expansion |

**The test**: If a senior executive reads *only the slide titles* in sequence, they should understand the complete argument and recommendation without seeing any body content.

Write the action titles *first*, before building any slides. Sequence them in a document. Read them in order. If they don't tell a coherent story, restructure before touching PowerPoint.

### Narrative Architecture Rules

**1. Lead with the answer.**
The audience should know your recommendation within the first few minutes. Everything that follows exists to support it. Don't make them wait until slide 17 to find out what you think. (If the most senior person leaves after 5 minutes, will they know your recommendation?)

**2. One idea per slide.**
If a slide has two key messages, it should be two slides. The action title is the forcing function — if you can't write a single-sentence title, the slide is trying to do too much.

**3. The Rule of Three.**
Support your main recommendation with three key reasons. Research shows that credibility peaks at three supporting arguments. Four feels like overkill; two feels incomplete.

**4. Every slide must earn its place.**
Apply the Chekhov's Gun test: if a slide doesn't directly support one of your three key reasons (which support your main recommendation), cut it. Interesting-but-tangential information weakens the narrative.

**5. Balance data and story.**
Alternate between quantitative evidence (charts, metrics) and qualitative evidence (examples, anecdotes, customer quotes). Pure data is forgettable. Pure story is unconvincing. The combination is persuasive.

**6. Make the audience the hero.**
Frame the narrative so the audience is the protagonist facing a challenge, and your recommendation is the tool that empowers them to overcome it. They are not passive recipients of your analysis — they are decision-makers you're equipping to act.

### Slide Sequence Template

For a standard recommendation deck, this sequence works:

```
1. Title slide
2. Executive Summary (your answer, 3 key reasons, in one slide)
3-4. Situation (shared context, what everyone agrees on)
5-6. Complication (the problem/change, with evidence)
7. The question this raises (transition slide)
8. Your recommendation (stated cleanly)
9-11. Reason 1 with supporting evidence (2-3 slides)
12-14. Reason 2 with supporting evidence (2-3 slides)
15-17. Reason 3 with supporting evidence (2-3 slides)
18. Risks and mitigations
19. Implementation roadmap / next steps
20. Call to action (what you need from this audience)
```

Adapt the length and emphasis based on context, but the structural logic — answer first, then supporting argument, then ask — should remain.

## Part 3: Connecting the Two Skills

Insight extraction and narrative construction are two halves of the same process:

1. **Extract** — Read source material through the five lenses. Apply the "so what" test recursively. Surface what matters, not just what was said.

2. **Organize** — Arrange insights into SCQA structure. Identify which insights serve as Situation (context), which reveal the Complication (the problem), and which point toward the Answer (your recommendation).

3. **Argue** — Turn each supporting insight into an action-titled slide. Ensure the sequence of titles tells a complete, logical story.

4. **Contrast** — Weave in the Sparkline pattern. For each section, show "what is" and "what could be" to create tension and momentum.

5. **Pressure-test** — Read only the slide titles in sequence. Does the story make sense? Is the "so what" clear? Would a skeptic be persuaded? Would someone new to the domain understand the stakes?

### Quality Checklist

Before delivering any synthesis or presentation narrative, verify:

- [ ] The main insight/recommendation is stated in the first 10% of the output
- [ ] Every major claim passes the "so what" test at least two levels deep
- [ ] Implicit knowledge has been made explicit for the audience
- [ ] Numbers and claims are contextualized (compared to what?)
- [ ] The narrative has tension — a clear problem that the recommendation resolves
- [ ] Slide titles (if applicable) tell a complete story when read in sequence
- [ ] Supporting arguments are grouped logically (ideally in threes)
- [ ] There is a clear call to action — what the audience should do next
- [ ] Nothing is included that doesn't serve the argument
- [ ] The audience's perspective and knowledge level have been accounted for
