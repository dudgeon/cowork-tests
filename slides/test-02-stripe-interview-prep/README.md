Setup: a friend is prepping for an interview at Stripe; I generated a number of assets in Claude Cowork and asked Cowork to make a hybrid deck including both the process and some thoughts on how I would approach the exercise.

Total touch time, from receiving the interview prompt to final deck was likely ~20 mins.

I made zero manual edits to the deck and provided one round of light, high level feedback.
